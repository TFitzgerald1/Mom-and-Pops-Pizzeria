# Mom-and-Pops-Pizzeria
A project completed for my Intro to Software Engineering Class.

The project's premise was that I was approached by a mom and pop who needed a website for their upcoming pizzeria. I was tasked with creating a JAVA program that would simulate this website.
The program needed to be divided into two sections, one that the customers would interact with and one that employees would interact with. 

The customer's section needed to include subsections that would allow for "account creation / management" and "pizza ordering".

The employee's section needed to include subsections that would allow for "creating / closing tickets" and "processing payments".
